Have recently discovered what I think is some new freestanding barbell wrist roller tech. Short of buying a [premade one](insert link here), the only other set up I know of is using a [band](insert link here); I've come up with a way that uses cord tied to spring collars.

I like my method over the band method mostly because it doesn't stretch. I'm an upstairs neighbor, so I try to minimize banging my weights on the floor, and my band stretched so much when weighted that I had to shorten it/rack the bar higher than I prefer to keep it from bouncing into the ground at the bottom of every round. Probably could have solved this with a thicker/lower-stretch band, but I didn't have one on hand. Could also have probably racked the bar higher and stood on a box, but that seemed like a hassle.

The other thing I like about this way is there's less dead space when you go from flexion to extension. Using the band there's a point in between, where you're spinning the roller to get the band knot to turn over, but you're not moving the weight at all; it's just sitting at the bottom.

## What you need:
 - cord
 - spring collars
 - barbell/rack/weights

## What you do:
1. Rack your barbell. I've heard recommendations for shoulder height; I like it a little higher, at forehead height or so. I find at shoulder height I'm sometimes tempted to cheat by initiating the movement with my shoulders instead of my wrists.

2. Slide your spring collars on like so

4. Attach weight to the free end of the rope

Re:the knot: if any knot people can think of a better way to tie this, let me know; I spent a while futzing with it and this is the simplest thing I could come up with where I could roll both flexion and extension without the knot falling apart. I admit I'm not sure how strong it is. I think adding more weight should just pull the collars tighter, and neither they nor the knot should slip, but I haven't tested it with anything heavier than 45#. Very possible that it can't handle high loads; proceed with caution.
