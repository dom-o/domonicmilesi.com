<h1>Gravity Memory</h1>
<p>It's the card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)">Memory</a>, but the cards are all falling through the air. You have to stop them from falling while you play. The card designs are inspired by <a href="https://rhymesayers.com/artists/aesoprock">Aesop Rock</a>'s old Snapchat stories; they had a similar witchy feel.</p>
<p>If you are an animal for whom this is somehow extremely easy, please share your secrets. It's full-on impossible for me after 12 cards.</p>
<p>Made with javascript, using <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js</a> and <a href="https://requirejs.org/">require.js</a>. Can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/dom-o/route-descriptor">here</a>.</p>
